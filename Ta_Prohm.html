    <h1>Privacy Policy for Ta Prohm</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 26, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Ta Prohm ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Ta Prohm (the "App"). Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App includes:</p>

    <h3>a. Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account, we may collect your name, email address, and password.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Information:</strong> If you create a store within the App, we collect all the information you provide, such as the store name, description, physical address/location, photos, contact information, and business hours.</li>
        <li><strong>User Content:</strong> We collect information you provide when you write reviews, leave ratings, or communicate with us, such as through customer support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> To provide the core feature of our App (finding stores "near you"), we request and collect precise location data from your mobile device (e.g., GPS coordinates), either continuously or while you are using the App, based on your device settings. You can disable location services, but this will severely limit the App's functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may automatically collect information about how you access and use the App, such as your IP address, device type, operating system, pages viewed, features used, and the dates and times of your access.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> Information about your mobile device, such as your device ID, model, and manufacturer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our App.</li>
        <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
        <li>Display store information and user-generated content (like reviews) to other users.</li>
        <li>Show you relevant stores based on your location.</li>
        <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our App.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, for customer service, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the App.</li>
        <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience.</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent fraudulent activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Publicly:</strong> Information you provide for your store profile (name, location, description, photos) and any reviews you write will be publicly visible to all users of the App. Your username may be displayed with your reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services for us or on our behalf, such as cloud hosting, map services (e.g., Google Maps), and data analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we are required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

    <p>You have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can review and change your account and store information at any time by logging into your account settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> You can change your mobile device's settings to disable the collection of location information at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your account and personal data by contacting us at the email address below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
